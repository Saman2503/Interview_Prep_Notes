-	typeof Null gives an object where as typeof undefined gives an undefined in javascript.

-	typeof Operator Results

			Type of val 														Result

-	Undefined                                                                                                              "undefined"

-	String                                                                                                                     "string"

-	Object (native and does not implement [[Call]])                                                 "object"

-	Undefined (native or host and does implement [[Call]])                                     "fucntion"

-	Undefined (host and does not implement [[Call]])                                              implement defined except may not be " undefined",                         																       "boolean", "number", or "string".

-	JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies.

-	Shallow Copies => A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the same references (point to the same 	underlying values) as those of the source object from which the copy was made.

-	Splice also make changes in the original array in from which the operations are taking place.

-	concat always return a new array without affecting any of the previous arrays.

-	how to use a symbol in an object in javascript
	We use the symbol as follows:
	const mySym = Symbol "key1"
	const Juser = {
		name: "saman",
		age: 23,
		[mySym]: "mykey1"
	}
	This is the perfect way to use a symbol inside an object

-	We can also use this way but the typeof symbol object is string here in this case
	const mySym = Symbol "key1"
	const Juser = {
		name: "saman",
		age: 23,
		mySym: "mykey1"
	}
	in the above example mySym is working as a string datatype

-	Mostly we use the elements of objects through dot operator always.

-	const obj3 = Object.assign(obj1, obj2, obj4)
	In the above syntax the obj1 is the target object and the objects obj2 and obj4 are the source objects.
