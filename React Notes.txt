-> Virtual DOM - key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priorty to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

-> Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM

-> Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique.

-> The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.

-> onClick always takes a function in it not return value of the function
	ex - 
		const [color, setColor] = useState("olive")
		onClick={() => setColor("gold")}

	In the above example we used the syntax because if we use it as 
		- onClick{setColor("gold")} then this means that setColor("gold")} is passing a return value to the onClick Property but the onClick property needs a function in it;
		
		- We can also write as onClick{setColor}, in this we passed a reference of the function in onClick property which is not wrong but the setColor doesnot do anything as no arguments are passed so no point to write the given line.

- useEffect, useRef these are the hooks used for more code optimization so that you can remove the chances of minimal errors that can affect your application.

- to use loops in react we should try to use key it enhances the performance

- We don't use 'a' tag in react instead we use 'link' tag which resist the page reload functionality
